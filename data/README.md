## Data


Data collected using the Apple Watch is available on PhysioNet: [link](https://alpha.physionet.org/content/sleep-accel/1.0.0/)

The MESA dataset is available for download at the [National Sleep Research Resource](https://sleepdata.org)


To run the code, move data from those resources to the subfolders in the data folder.
